This project consists of balls inside a rectangular box that contains them.
There are many variables that you can control, such as the number of balls, gravity, air density, bouncing force, and wind direction.
At the end of these variables, there is a reset button to return all the variables to their natural values.
This project helps in studying gravity, density, bouncing force, and Young’s modulus.
